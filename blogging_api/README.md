*Create the Django project app:*
django-admin startproject blogging_api
cd blog_api
python manage.py startapp blog

*Create the requirement.txt file:*
Django~=4.2.11

*Install Django Rest Framework:*
pip install djangorestframework

*Add 'rest_framework' and 'blog' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:*

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'rest_framework',
    'blog',
    # other apps
]

*In models.py, define the models for Blog Posts, Categories, Tags, and Users*

*In serializers.py, create serializers for the models to transform data into JSON format.*

*create views*
In views.py, create views for handling CRUD operations. I used DRF’s GenericAPIView and mixins for simplicity.

*set up url routing*

*User Authentication and Permission*
Used Django’s built-in authentication and DRF’s permission system to restrict access to the API. In settings.py, authentication classes was enabled.

To make authentication token-based (using JWT),
djangorestframework-simplejwt 
for JWT authentication.


*For Filtering and Searching*
django-filter was installed, 
adding filtering and search functionality to views:


*Pagination and Sorting*
In settings.py, pagination and sorting was configured.

Step 5: Test JWT Authentication
Once you've configured JWT, you can test the authentication flow using tools like curl or Postman.

First, obtain an access token using your login credentials:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -d "username=myuser&password=mypassword" http://localhost:8000/api/token/
This returns an access token and a refresh token.

Use the access token in subsequent requests to authenticated endpoints, passing it in the Authorization header:
bash
Copy code
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" http://localhost:8000/api/posts/
